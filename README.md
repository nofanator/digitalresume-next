# Digital Resume (Next.js)

This repository is a quick port of my original digital resume to Next.js and Contentful, serving as a proof of concept (POC) for a statically generated CMS-driven website. The emphasis was on demonstrating the feasibility of using Next.js with Static Site Generation (SSG) rather than focusing on code quality during the porting process.

The previous version can be found at [https://github.com/nofanator/digitalresume](https://github.com/nofanator/digitalresume).

## Key Features

-   **Next.js Framework with SSG:** The resume is developed using the Next.js framework, enabling Static Site Generation to pre-render the resume pages at build time. This approach enhances performance and provides SEO benefits.
-   **Contentful CMS Integration:** Contentful serves as the CMS, offering an intuitive interface for managing and updating the resume content. The data is retrieved using GraphQL queries, enabling efficient retrieval of specific content.
-   **Azure Hosting:** The resume site is hosted on Azure, leveraging its reliable infrastructure and scalability to ensure smooth access and availability.
-   **Cloudflare Integration:** Cloudflare is utilized for enhanced security and performance, providing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and DNS management services.
-   **Responsive Design:** The resume is designed to be responsive, adapting seamlessly to various devices and screen sizes.
